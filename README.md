# Resistors.fyi

Simple resistor calculator.

## Development

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Deployment

You can configure GitHub pages to host a subfolder, so just configure it to host
the `dist/` folder.

## TODO

* [x] Add license
* [ ] Accessibility - screen readers
* [ ] Accessibility - vague colors
* [x] Deploy (gh-pages on npm?)
